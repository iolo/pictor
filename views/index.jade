  h3 Introduction

  p Local storages and traffic are *expensive*, especially in cloud envionment.
  p There're many *cheap* and *large* cloud/remote storages services, most of them provide *cheap* and *fast* HTTP access.
  p ex. Amazon S3, FTP+HTTP Static Image Hosting Services...

  p Pictor is designed for these environment.

  p Pictor basically works as following:

    ul
      li *upload* is accomplished by Pictor. cloud/remote storage can do if possible.
      li *convert* is accomplished by Pictor.
      li *download* is accomlished by cloud/remote storage. Pictor can do if you want.
      li all files are stored in cloud/remote storage. local storage can do if you want.
      li all converted files(generated by Pictor) could be deleted *at any anytime*. Pictor will re-generate them on demand.
