why pictor
----------

Local storages and traffic are *expensive*, especially in cloud envionment.

There're many *cheap* and *large* cloud/remote storages services,
most of them provide *cheap* and *fast* HTTP access.

ex. Amazon S3, FTP+HTTP Static Image Hosting Services...

pictor is designed for these environment.

pictor basically works as following:

- *upload* is accomplished by pictor. cloud/remote storage can do if possible.
- *convert* is accomplished by pictor.
- *download* is accomlished by cloud/remote storage. pictor can do if you want.
- all files are stored in cloud/remote storage. local storage can do if you want.
- all variant files(generated by pictor) could be deleted *at any anytime*. pictor will generate it on demand.
